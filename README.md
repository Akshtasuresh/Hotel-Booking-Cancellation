# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation
This is a Machine Learning Project where different ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Decision Trees are applied to the Hotel Booking data and model optimization is performed using Grid Search to predict the rate of future cancellations.
•	Performed ETL on the data and defined data types to improve efficiency.
•	Performed EDA and feature engineering on the data.
•	Created and trained 3 classification models namely Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Random Forest.
•	Implemented Grid Search for model optimization on Random Forest model.
•	Evaluated the performace of the models using confusion matrix.
•	Finally presented the best model for the prediction from the above set of trained models.
